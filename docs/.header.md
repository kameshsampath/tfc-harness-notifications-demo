      - iam.serviceAccounts.create
      - iam.serviceAccounts.delete
      - iam.serviceAccounts.update
      - iam.serviceAccounts.get
      - iam.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy
      - iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy
     Or simply you can add `Service Account Admin` and `Service Account User` roles
    - `Compute Network Admin`   - to create the VPC networks

### Optional tools

- [direnv](https://direnv.net)

## Download Sources

Clone the sources,

```shell
git clone https://github.com/harness-apps/tfc-notifications-demo.git && cd "$(basename "$_" .git)"
export PROJECT_HOME="$PWD"
```

(OR) If you are using zsh, then you can use the following commands

```shell
take  https://github.com/harness-apps/tfc-notifications-demo.git
export PROJECT_HOME="$PWD"
```

## Environment Setup

### Variables

When working with Google Cloud the following environment variables helps in setting the right Google Cloud context like Service Account Key file, project etc., You can use [direnv](https://direnv.net) or set the following variables on your shell,

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="the google cloud service account key json file to use"
export CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME="the google cloud cli profile to use"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="the google cloud project to use"
```

You can find more information about gcloud cli configurations at <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/configurations>.

As you may need to override few terraform variables that you don't want to check in to VCS, add them to a file called `.local.tfvars` and set the following environment variable to be picked up by terraform runs,

```shell
export TFVARS_FILE=.local.tfvars
```

>**NOTE**: All `*.local.tfvars` file are git ignored by this template.

Check the [Inputs](#inputs) section for all possible variables that are configurable.
