### Example
  
An example `.local.tfvars` that will use a Google Cloud project **my-awesome-project**, create Google Compute Engine VM named **harness-cie-delegate** in region **asia-south1**. The machine type of each cluster node will be **n2-standard-4**.

You may need to update following values with actuals from your Harness Account,

- `harness_account_id`
- `harness_delegate_token`

> **NOTE**:
> 
> - `harness_manager_endpoint` value is can be found here <https://developer.harness.io/tutorials/platform/install-delegate/>, to right endpoint check for your **Harness Cluster Hosting Account** from the Harness Account Overview page.
> In the example above my **Harness Cluster Hosting Account** is **prod-2** and its endpoint is <https://app.harness.io/gratis>
>

```hcl
project_id                 = "my-awesome-project"
region                     = "asia-south1"
harness_account_id         = "REPLACE WITH YOUR HARNESS ACCOUNT ID"
harness_delegate_token     = "REPLACE WITH YOUR HARNESS DELEGATE TOKEN"
harness_delegate_name      = "harness-cie-delegate"
```

> **NOTE**: For rest of the section we assume that your tfvars file is called `.local.tfvars`
